# WasteWatcher-OakCodefest-21
Our project, WasteWatcher, aims to help people make educated decisions about their food choices, by analyzing their wasting patterns. We are going to analyze the types and compositions of foods that are being wasted and  present this data to the user. We will also make recommendations about what foods should be bought and their recommended quantities. Additionally, if the users opt-in, we send data to local suppliers to inform them about products that should be made more easily available, increasing their revenue and sales as well.
